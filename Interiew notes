✅ Interview Answer – Kubernetes Components (Control Plane & Worker Node)
🧠 1. Control Plane Components

The control plane is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It makes global decisions about the cluster, like scheduling, scaling, and healing.
🔹 a. API Server (kube-apiserver)

    The front door of the Kubernetes cluster.

    It exposes the Kubernetes API and is the communication hub between all components (CLI, UI, internal components).

    All kubectl commands interact with the API server.

    🧠 Analogy: Think of it as the reception desk of a company. Every request goes through it — it authenticates, validates, and routes to the right department.

🔹 b. Scheduler (kube-scheduler)

    Decides which node a new pod should run on.

    It considers resource requirements, taints/tolerations, node affinity, and constraints.

    🧠 Analogy: Like a job placement officer assigning tasks to employees based on skills and workload.

🔹 c. Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)

    Runs various controllers that maintain cluster state, like:

        Node controller (monitors node health)

        ReplicaSet controller (ensures correct pod count)

        Endpoints controller, Job controller, etc.

    These controllers continuously reconcile the desired state with the actual state.

    🧠 Analogy: Think of it as a team of supervisors making sure everything stays on track.

🔹 d. etcd (Key-Value Store)

    The backend database for Kubernetes.

    Stores all cluster data including config, secrets, and state.

    It's a distributed, consistent, and highly available key-value store.

    🧠 Analogy: Like a filing cabinet or brain memory where all decisions and records are stored.

🔹 e. (Optional) Cloud Controller Manager

    Integrates with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

    Handles cloud-specific resources like load balancers, nodes, storage volumes.

    🧠 Analogy: A cloud integration officer that talks to external service providers.

🖥️ 2. Worker Node Components

The worker nodes are where the actual applications (containers) run.
🔹 a. Kubelet

    Agent running on each node.

    Receives PodSpecs from the API server and ensures the containers are running as expected.

    Reports health/status back to the control plane.

    🧠 Analogy: Like a factory worker executing tasks assigned by management.

🔹 b. Container Runtime

    The software responsible for running containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).

    Kubelet interacts with it to start/stop containers.

    🧠 Analogy: Like the machinery in the factory that actually does the work.

🔹 c. kube-proxy

    Manages network rules on nodes.

    Enables service-to-pod communication using cluster IPs.

    Handles routing, NAT, and forwarding.

    🧠 Analogy: Acts as a network traffic officer, making sure data reaches the right pods.
